## Building Docker Images

There are 3 images vended by this repository: 
- `faiss-base`
  - Uses NVIDIA CUDA image as a base image
  - Adds the dependencies needed to install `faiss`, and builds `faiss` from source
- `core`
  - Uses `faiss-base` as a base image
  - Adds the code for the core index build functionalities: building an index and remote store I/O
- `api`
  - Uses `core` as a base image
  - Adds the code for a `fastAPI` server with `_build` and `_status` APIs
    - The `_build` API triggers an index build workflow and returns a job id to the caller 
    - The `_status` API gets the status of the workflow, given a job id
    - The index build workflow is executed in the background, using the `core` library functions

The Github CIs automatically publish snapshot images to Dockerhub at [opensearchstaging/remote-vector-index-builder](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensearchstaging/remote-vector-index-builder).

The following are the commands to build the images locally:

### Faiss Base Image
The [Faiss repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/) is added as a submodule in this repository. Run the below command to initialize the submodule first.
```
git submodule update --init
```
The `faiss-base` image can only be created on an NVIDIA GPU powered machine with CUDA Toolkit installed.

Please see the section [Provisioning an instance for development](#provisioning-an-instance-for-development) to provision an instance for development.

Run the below command to create the `faiss-base` image:
```
docker build  -f ./base_image/build_scripts/Dockerfile . -t opensearchstaging/remote-vector-index-builder:faiss-base-latest
```

### Core Image
The path [`/remote-vector-index-builder/core`](/remote_vector_index_builder/core/) contains the code for the `core` image.
Run the below command to create the `core` image:

```
docker build  -f ./remote_vector_index_builder/core/Dockerfile . -t opensearchstaging/remote-vector-index-builder:core-latest
```

The image can be built on any type of machine with `docker` installed

### API Image
The path [`/remote-vector-index-builder/app`](/remote_vector_index_builder/app/) contains the code for the `api` image. 
Run the below command to create `api` image. 

```
docker build  -f ./remote_vector_index_builder/app/Dockerfile . -t opensearchstaging/remote-vector-index-builder:api-latest
```

The image can be built on any type of machine with `docker` installed

Note that any docker image tag can be used when building locally. It may be more useful to tag the image with a personal dockerhub name, 
in order to push the image to your remote dockerhub account. 

## Provisioning an instance for development

A NVIDIA GPU powered machine with CUDA Toolkit installed is required to build a Faiss base image and to run the Docker images to build an index.

Typically an [EC2 G5](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/) 2xlarge instance running a Deep Learning OSS Nvidia Driver AMI with Docker CLI installed is recommended for development use.

[Setup an EC2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)

## Running Docker Images

### Run the API Image as standalone container
The API image implements the [Remote Vector Service API Contract](/API.md). It provides out-of-the-box APIs
that directly integrate with the OpenSearch k-NN Remote Vector Service Client. The default image
configuration allows it to be used to run integration tests for the OpenSearch k-NN Remote Vector component.
This configuration maintains the job state in an in-memory dictionary with a TTL, and uses a fixed size
thread pool to execute index build workflows. But, the dictionary size and TTL is also controllable via the Docker container settings. For example, you can set the TTL
to `None`, to ensure requests never get deleted.

Follow the steps below to use run the API image locally. Note that s3 is currently the only supported Remote Store repository
1. [Provision an instance for development](#provisioning-an-instance-for-development)
2. Create a s3 bucket, upload vector and doc id binaries to the bucket
3. Ensure the instance has AWS credentials to connect with the s3 bucket
    - Use any option from 3-11: [Configuring credentials](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html#configuring-credentials)
4. Clone the repository to the instance
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/opensearch-project/remote-vector-index-builder.git
    ```
5. Change into the top-level directory:
    ```
    cd remote-vector-index-builder
    ```
6. Build the docker image. Note that any image tag can be used, not just `opensearchstaging/remote-vector-index-builder:api-latest`: 
    ```
    docker build  -f ./remote_vector_index_builder/app/Dockerfile . -t opensearchstaging/remote-vector-index-builder:api-latest
    ```
7. Run the docker image: 
    ```
    docker run -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 --gpus all -p 80:1025 opensearchstaging/remote-vector-index-builder:api-latest
    ```
8. In a separate terminal, issue a build request:
    ```
    curl -XPOST "http://0.0.0.0:80/_build" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '
        {
            "repository_type": "s3",
            "container_name": "<your_s3_bucket>>",
            "vector_path": "<vector_path_in_s3_bucket>",
            "doc_id_path": "<doc_id_path_in_s3_bucket>",
            "dimension": "<vector dimension>",
            "doc_count": "<number of vectors>"
        }
    '
    ```
   This will return a job id, if the build request was successfully submitted.
9. Check the status of your build request:
    ```
    curl -XGET "http://0.0.0.0:80/_status/<job_id>"
    ```

## Memory Profiling

Simple memory profiling can be done during development to get memory usage statistics during the Index Build process.

### GPU Memory Profiling with NVIDIA SMI

1. Install [py3nvml](https://pypi.org/project/py3nvml/): In [`/remote_vector_index_builder/core/requirements.txt`](/remote_vector_index_builder/core/requirements.txt) add `py3nvml` on a newline.

2. Add import statement and initialize method in the file containing the driver code.
```
from py3nvml import nvidia_smi
nvidia_smi.nvmlInit()
```

3. Define and call the below method wherever necessary. e.g. before and after calling the GPU index cleanup method.
```
from py3nvml import nvidia_smi

def get_gpu_memory():
    handle = nvidia_smi.nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex(0)  # GPU Device ID
    info = nvidia_smi.nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo(handle)
    print(f"Total: {info.total/1024**2:.2f}MB")
    print(f"Free: {info.free/1024**2:.2f}MB")
    print(f"Used: {info.used/1024**2:.2f}MB")

```

### CPU Memory Profiling with memory_profiler

1. Add the below command in [`/remote_vector_index_builder/core/Dockerfile`](/remote_vector_index_builder/core/Dockerfile) to install [memory_profiler](https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/).
```
RUN conda install -c conda-forge memory_profiler -y
```

2. In the file that contains the function that needs to be profiled, add the import and an `@profile` annotation on the function.
```
from memory_profiler import profile

@profile
def my_func():
    a = [1] * (10 ** 6)
    b = [2] * (2 * 10 ** 7)
    del b
    return a
```
